  Firebase is a mobile and web developement platform(backend) which was acquired by google in 2014. It evolved from a startup started by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011 call Envolve(provided developers with an API which enabled the integration of online chat functionality to their site)
  
  -Firebase became what it is since the creators of Envolve noticed that developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as a game state in real time across their users. This led the founders to separate the chat system and create Firebase which provides "real-time functionality for backend services".
  
It provides admins with many tools to manage their app:
  -Daily active users
  -crash percentage
  -revenue
  - Day 1 retention (amount of people who have stayed on your app since day 1)
     - mobile (ios vs android)
  -Crashlytics(Google acquired from Twitter)
    -keeps track of your crashes of your app.
    -gives you top issues in your app
    -gives statistics on which mobile crashes more (android vs ios)
     
It Provides:
  -Auth
  -Database
  -Firestore(scalable NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development)
  -Firebase Hosting - allows you deploy your app
  - It is not totally free. (https://firebase.google.com/pricing/)
